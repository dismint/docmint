= Why Learn About Proteins?

There are a couple valuable aspects of learning protein structures:

- We can learn about the function
- Develop drugs
- Understand how mutations impact the protein
- Synthetic Proteins

#define(
  title: "Residue"
)[
  In the context of a protein, a residue refers to a singular unit in a polymer, such as the amino.

= Reactions

The transition state of a reaction is the peak at the top when the reaction "happens". If free energy is lost, then we consider it a spontaneous (exergonic) reaction. The opposite side is endergonic (non-spontaneous) reactions.

The activation energy is the difference between the starting energy and the transition state ($E_a$). Having a catalyst does not change the $Delta G$, but it decreases the activation energy.

= Enzymes 

Most biological catalysts are proteins called enzymes.

To control the pace at which enzymes react, *inhibitors* will control the way in which substrates bind to the enzyme.

/ Reversible: A temporarily blocker on the enzyme that can be let go later.
/ Irreversible: A permanent blocker - a new one must be acquired to bind to a substrate.
/ Allosteric: Doesn't bind directly to the site, alters the enzymes ability and functionality to interact with the substrates.

This document will be a comprehensive set of notes covering the content in the set of tweets by user `@binneulbinism`, linked #link("https://twitter.com/binneulbinism/status/1757853566033592793")[here]. I will attempt to be as friendly as possible to the average human, but this set of notes will mostly be fine tuned to my knowledge base, supplemented greatly by my significant other, #link("https://www.linkedin.com/in/annie-wang-184361221")[Annie Wang].

As a disclaimer, I will not be covering all the content present in the source material, rather I will be picking points that I deem to be of significance. Points are organized into tiers, with higher numbers meaning deeper levels in the iceberg.

Now let us start delving into the intricacies of the complicated world of Haobin.

= Tier 1

#note(
  title: "Current Status"
)[
  Haobin has good chemisty and are cute together! I'm excited to see what I can learn about them :3
]

== "Hyung is my crying button" <crybutton>

Allegedly something that HB said to ZH during their Tomboy era when he was under a lot of stress. Happened in the laundry room (where there are no cameras). Pretty cute especially considering the vibe they both give off on BP would seem to indicate HB takes on a much more hyung-like position in the relationship. Makes you wonder what else was true about BP behind the scenes that we didn't get to see as the average viewer.

== "Let's drink zero cola everyday"

During the second elimination round (when they were the top two contestants), when asked if they wanted to say anything to the other person, this is what ZH said to HB. Of course the insinuation is that he wants them to debut together. Very cute since they seemed to get super close during the Tomboy period as a whole.

#define(
  title: "Haobinists"
)[
  Casual and more informal term used to refer to people who ship ZH and HB.
]

#define(
  title: "Zerocolas"
)[
  Haobin supporters are commonly called Zerocolas due to the above. This term is generally used to refer to the Chinese part of Haobinists.
]

== BP Massage

After the event described #link(label("crybutton"))[above], ZH jokingly asks HB to give him a massage in return. As a result, HB very shockingly, and not at all jokingly gives him a massage. Footage is filmed from a camera in the corner of the room while pitch black and feels a bit like you stumbled upon your parents' years old camcorder labeled "DO NOT WATCH".

== Blue and Pink

During BP, blue and pink were used to refer to the Korean and Global groups respectively. They have now become used to refer to HB and ZH.

== Paris Selfie

#define(
  title: "RPS"
)[
  Copy-pasted from Google because I had no clue what this meant.

  #quote(attribution: "Urban Dictionary", block: true)[
    A popular although slightly controversial genre of fanfiction involving real life people. Namely actors, musicians, athletes, politicians... etc. Basically anyone who is in the public eye. RPS stories or {fics} depict a romantic and/or sexual relationship between two members of the same sex.
  Different from {fanfiction} or {fanfic} which involve fictional characters.
  Follows the same general traditions of fictional slash, with separate cliques, fanlistings and archives.
  ]

  The actual *S* part is up for debate, most things I search up seem to indicate it stands for *Slash*, however my beautiful booboo partner seems to suggest it stands for *Shipping* as slash generally refers to same sex shipping, and in general is quite an outdated term.
]

#twocol(
  align(horizon)[
    This is the alleged offender image which caused so much ruckus among Haobinists. Supposedly this can be cited as one of the foundational moments for the start of RPS regarding Haobin.

    It's pretty fucking cute.

== Dolphin Story

#define(
  title: "Tingle"
)[
  An ASMR show for KPOP idols.
]

While in BP, there was a random van with a dolphin on the side, and HB asked ZH what "dolphin" was in Mandarin after telling him what it was in Korean. This was at the very beginning when they didn't know each other that well, so this whole interaction was undoubtedly a very important moment for them, and one they probably remembered as one of their earliest times talking to each other.

Speeding forward a little bit, while on Tingle, they revealed that HB's contact name for ZH has a dolphin in it.

=== Tingle

This exact Tingle episode is pretty significant as it is one of the only forms of content that exist where it is just the two of them answering questions about e/o. 

It also apparently includes lots of other fancervicy things like *SMELLING EACH OTHER'S BREATH*.

I imagine this is to Haobinists what Leetcode is to little children trying to get a job in CS.

== First TikTok

HB and ZH filmed their first TikTok together on *Valentine's* day. A little scandalous if you ask me... `o.O`

== Nick & Judy

#define(
  title: "FPS"
)[
  A made up term based on *RPS* from earlier. It stands for "Fake Persons Shipping".
]

The two of them did Nick and Judy challenge, where they essentially recreate an *FPS* between two characters from Zootopia. The chemistry was excellent and it's clear the two care a lot about each other! 

= Tier 2

#note(
  title: "Current Status"
)[
  Oh my are we here already. Still think the two of these are CAF (cute as fuck). I say HB is the bottom and ZH is the top. I am 99% sure this is quite a controversial take but I will defend it until the day I die (at least for now).
]

== Take a Look at My GF

Haobin attempts the (to me) very cringe trend except they don't use the official audio but it's the exact same format.

== Mirrorz

Another name given to Haobinists, referring to ZH saying "it was like talking to a mirror" (obviously talking about HB). HB says a similar thing post-finale.

== "The other half of my soul"

HB $=>$ ZH

Me wiping away happy tears.

== "When Hao-hyung started playing violin"

HB's answer to one of his BBL lives about what his first impression of ZH was.

== First Conversation

Apparently happened when they were voting for visuals in BP and they revealed that they had voted for each other. This was the event that supposedly broke the ice between them.

If this is true this is really cute...

== "Look forward to a lot of Haobin in the future"

HB comment on the YouTube video of the Tomboy performance - like what else am I supposed to take away from this...?

== "Honestly you came to Tomboy because of me right?"

ZH $=>$ HB. HB shyly says yes.

== BP Finals

During the finale, staff wanted them as first and second to go up separately, but instead they went up the steps to the top 9 together... *HOLDING HANDS*

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

= Tier 3

  Tier 2 was kinda short, hopefully it will pick up soon!
